# Drogon / C++

I am just curious which one does a better job when it comes to simple web servers - C++ or Rust.

For this particualr project I have picked Drogon , a C++ framework designed for building scalable web applications. 
I want to explore the world of C++ a bit more and compare its performance, architecture, and tooling with the Rust implementation(see my other repo,I'm developing them side by side). 
Both languages offer unique advantages, and by developing servers in each, I am gaining insights into the strengths and trade-offs between these two.

While I am a huge fan of both , I can't help but wonder which one could be a better fit: 
Rust is all about safety but C++ has decades of evolution and is a more mature language overall, 
with a whole new set of features and capabilities that make it incredibly powerful.
